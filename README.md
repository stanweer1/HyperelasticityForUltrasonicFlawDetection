# HyperelasticityForUltrasonicFlawDetection

This repository hosts vumat, umat, uhyper and vuanisohyper subrotuines together with example input files for simulating the wave response of certain structure under provided excitation. These were used in the research published here: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/16/5498
